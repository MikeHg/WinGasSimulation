# WinGasSimulation

This project uses a C++ thread pool library from Barak Shoshany that can be found here https://github.com/bshoshany/thread-pool
For convenience the library is already placed in the "include" directory.

The project requires Visual Studio 2022 and the Intel Compiler installed (for higher precision).
